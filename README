Provide a -config myconfig.config param to the vm on startup of put all your tempates in priv/templates.

The former is better. Something like

[{tempile, [{root, "/my/webapp/priv/templates/"}]}].

in a myapp.config will get all xxxx.* compiled as mustache templates. The use

tempile:render("templatename", contect_dict).

to render.

Still to do is recompile and cache templates on change. 
Also want to allow swapping templating to erlydtl or what-have-you later.
